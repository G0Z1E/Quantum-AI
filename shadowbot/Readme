# ShadowBot – Defensive Automation Assistant

## Overview

ShadowBot is a **defensive automation and monitoring tool** designed to run safe system commands, collect host and network snapshots, schedule recurring jobs, and log all activity.
It simulates a “shadow operations” assistant **without performing offensive or malicious actions**.

ShadowBot is built for:

* Cybersecurity labs
* Security automation coursework
* System monitoring
* Ethical, authorized environments only

It uses a **strict command policy** to prevent dangerous or exploitative commands from running.

---

## Key Features

* **Command Policy Enforcement** – Blocks risky or malicious commands by default
* **System & Network Sensors** – Collects host, network, and disk snapshots
* **Scheduler** – Runs monitoring jobs at set intervals
* **Authorized Scanning Only** – Nmap scans allowed only for whitelisted targets
* **Centralized Logging** – Logs to console and file
* **CLI Interface** – Simple command-line usage
* **Modular Design** – Easy to extend or integrate into other AI frameworks

## Requirements

* Python **3.10+**
* Linux environment recommended
* Nmap (optional, only for scanning feature)

Install Nmap (Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt install nmap
```

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shadowbot.git
cd shadowbot
```

(Optional but recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Configuration

Create your configuration file:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "authorized_targets": ["192.168.40.130"],
  "nmap_args": ["nmap", "-Pn", "-sC", "-sV"],
  "jobs": {
    "host_snapshot": 300,
    "network_snapshot": 300,
    "disk_snapshot": 600
  }
}
```

---

## Usage

### Run a Safe Command

```bash
python3 shadowbot.py --config config.json run --exec "uptime"
```

If a command violates policy, it will be **blocked and logged**.

---

### Run Authorized Nmap Scan

```bash
python3 shadowbot.py --config config.json scan --target 192.168.40.130
```

⚠️ The target **must** be listed in `authorized_targets`.

---

### Run Scheduled Monitoring Jobs

Run continuously:

```bash
python3 shadowbot.py --config config.json loop
```

Run one cycle only:

```bash
python3 shadowbot.py --config config.json loop --once
```

---

## Command Policy (Security)

ShadowBot uses a **deny-first security model**:

* Reverse shells, password cracking, exploitation tools, and destructive commands are blocked
* Only safe, read-only, diagnostic commands are allowed
* Commands are logged whether allowed or blocked

This ensures ShadowBot remains **defensive and ethical**.

---

## Logging

Logs are stored in:

```
.shadowbot_logs/shadowbot.log
```

Each log entry includes:

* Timestamp
* Action taken
* Command executed or blocked
* System snapshot events

---

## Ethical Use Statement

ShadowBot is intended for:

* Defensive security automation
* Education and lab environments
* Authorized system monitoring

**Do not use ShadowBot for unauthorized access, exploitation, or surveillance.**

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with Quantum AI engine
* JSON and CSV reporting
* Email or dashboard alerts
* Docker deployment
* AI-driven anomaly detection

If you want, next I can:

* Merge **ShadowBot into Quantum AI** as a skill
* Add a **course-rubric section**
* Create a **Dockerfile + README addendum**
* Generate **screenshots + usage diagrams**
